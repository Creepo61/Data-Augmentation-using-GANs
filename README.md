In this repository you will find a notebook giving you an CycleGAN and Pix2Pix approach for translating an image from a Domain $X$ to a Domain $Y$.

This repository is for educational purposes only and was part of a project at Chemnitz University of Technology investigating if image to image translating could be a vald technique for data augmentation. Thanks to IAV Chemnitz for suggesting this topic.
